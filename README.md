# autonomous-sanitize-robot
Developed a fully autonomous sanitizer robot using ROS2 for multi-room environments. The system performs SLAM-based mapping and localization, plans paths to room centers, and executes complete coverage using Boustrophedon decomposition. Simulated in Gazebo with real-time visualization in Rviz.
